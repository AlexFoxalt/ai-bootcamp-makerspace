ABOUT THE AUTHOR

I hope you will find this collection of recipes
interesting and appetizing. I've enjoyed putting together
an assortment of dishes that I personally enjoy cooking
(and eating!). My interest in cooking originated when I
was young, growing up in a Chinese family with 9 children,
where knowing how to cook well was not so much of an art
but a necessity.
Cooking Chinese is easy and fun. Please try these recipes and
forward your comments to me. Let me know what you like
or would like to try. Enjoy Life - Eat Chinese!
Have fun in the kitchen, Ailam

COOKING TIPS
Garnish; after carving or cutting fruit and vegetables (especially
carrot and pepper) into flowers or patterns for garnishing, soak in
water. This will keep them in nicer shape and reduce breakage.

●

Utensils for stir-frying; a wok is the best utensil because its big
surface is easy for stirring the food and enables the most contact of
the food with a hot surface. If not available, use a big skillet or
saucepan.

●

Ingredients for stir-frying; cut the meat or vegetables into uniform
size, this will allow them to cook within the same time.

●

Before stir-frying; cut and gather all the ingredients together and
pre-mix the cooking sauce before starting the wok. Stir-frying takes
a very short time and so you will have no time for preparation during
stir-frying.

●

Stir-frying temperature and time; use high heat and short (but enough)
time to just cook the food. This will cap the meat's natural juices,
and also the color and crispness of vegetables.

●

Quick way to judge oil temperature for deep-frying; put a small piece
of green onion in the oil- at 350F, small bubbles appear and no sound;
at 375F, bigger bubbles appear with slight sizzling noise; at 400-425F,
bigger bubbles with sizzling noise and green onion tips turn golden
brown.

●

Pan-frying fish; add a pinch of salt to the hot oil before pan-frying
the fish, this will help reduce splash of oil when adding the fish
into wok.

●

Canned food products; soak in hot water for a few minutes, then rinse
with cold water before use. This will reduce the tin-smell of the
canned food products.

●

Steaming; always steam food to just slightly under cooked. The food
will continue cooking in the hot platter, so make sure it will not
over cook.

●

Steaming fish; when steaming a whole fish, the doneness can be
determined by the fish eyes. Once the fish eyes pop-up, it is cooked.

●

Blanching; add a few drops of oil to the boiling water. This will
help in keeping the fresh color of vegetables.· Blanching; after
removing the vegetables from hot water, rinse immediately with cold
water. This will keep the color, and vegetables are more tender and

●

crisp.

EATING WITH CHOPSTICKS
Chopsticks are not difficult to manage once you have learned the basic
technique.
The key is to hold the inside stick still while moving the outside
stick back and forth. The pair then acts as pincers to pick up pieces
of food.
Hold the thicker end of the first chopstick in the crook of your thumb,
resting the lower part lightly against the inside of your ring finger.
Then put the second chopstick between the tip of your index and middle
fingers and hold it with your thumb, much as you would hold a pencil.
Now you can make the outer chopstick move by bending your index and
middle fingers toward the inside chopstick. The tips of the two
sticks should come together like pincers when you bend your fingers.
Once you get a feel for the technique, just keep practicing.
Soon you will be an expert!
