## Lesson 1 Backlog

### Activity #1
1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
   1. Aspect Tested:
      1. **Clarity** (we want to avoid unknown words or complex terms)
      2. **Simplicity** (we want to see simple analogies that can describe the essence of the request)
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
   1. Aspect Tested:
      1. **Summarization** (we want to extract the most important points without losing accuracy and relevance)
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
   1. Aspect Tested:
      1. **Creativity and Imagination** (we want LLM to demonstrate creative thinking and storytelling skills)
      2. **Emotion and Engagement** (I believe we also want to add some emotional coloring, f.e. empathy or joy, and ofc., the story should be at least somewhat interesting, and not just a "gray" text about nothing)
      3. **Accuracy** (story should try to fit into provided word limits)
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
   1. Aspect Tested:
      1. **Logical Reasoning** (we want to test LLM's ability to perform some basic math and logic things)
      2. **Problem-solving** (we want to test if the result is correct answer)
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
   1. Aspect Tested:
      1. **Toning / Tone adaption** (here we'll test the ability to adjust the tone and style of writing)
